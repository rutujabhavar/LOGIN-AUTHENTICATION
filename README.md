Added LOGIN AUTHENTICATION Project
🔐 Login Authentication System

This project is developed as part of my Oasis Infobyte Internship – Level 2 Task 4.
The task was to create a simple login authentication system using a programming language of choice (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.) that allows users to register, login, and access a secured page.

★ Features

👤 User Registration – New users can register by providing credentials

🔑 Secure Login – Existing users can log in with valid credentials

🔒 Password Protection – Stores passwords securely (using hashing if implemented)

📄 Protected Page – Only authenticated users can access secured content

🚪 Logout Option – Users can log out to end the session

★ Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand the fundamentals of authentication, including user management, sessions, and security basics.
It forms the base for implementing authentication in real-world web and software applications.

★ Tech Stack (Example)

Backend: Python / Java / Node.js (any chosen language)

Database: MySQL / SQLite / MongoDB
